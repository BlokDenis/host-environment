Host Environment
==============================

### Easily detect what host environment your code is running in

When writing [universal JavaScript](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9), you often end up needing to know what environment your code is running in.  Maybe some functionality is only available in Node and not in web browsers.  Or maybe you need to determine whether to load a [polyfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)) library.

**Host Environment** makes it easy to write that kind of conditional code.



Example
--------------------------

```javascript
import host from "host-environment";

if (host.browser) {
  // Browser logic here

  if (host.browser.IE) {
    // Load a polyfill for Internet Explorer
  }
}

if (host.node) {
  // Node.js logic here

  if (host.node.version < 8) {
    // Load a polyfill for older versions of Node
  }

  if (host.os.windows) {
    // Windows-specific logic here
  }
}
```

Installation
--------------------------
Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/):

```bash
npm install host-environment
```



Usage
--------------------------
When using ES2015 syntax, you can simply `import` the `host` object:

```javascript
import host from "host-environment";
```

When using CommonJS syntax, we recommend that you `require()` the `host` object as a named export to ensure correct behavior with bundling tools like Webpack, Rollup, etc.

```javascript
const { host } = require("host-environment");
```
